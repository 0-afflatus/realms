        "description": "### Background to the 2040 Conflict\r\n\r\nBaresu\u00e2ni industrial and economic power grew greatly after the unification and the foundation of the Empire in 2001 following the Great Revolution. The newly formed socialist government put great resources into building up its navy, which developed into an industrial arms race between Baresu\u00e2n and Knebb. Dhex precipitated the Vubul crisis in 2010 by officially annexing the region which it had occupied since 2000. This angered the kingdom of Adhen and its patron the Western Yrsandin Church.\r\n\r\nRh\u00f4zad Vumir, having unsuccessfully attempted to overthrow the Baresu\u00e2nian government in 2033, eventually became the President of Baresu\u00e2n in 2037 after the mysterious disappearance of his parents, the Emperor and Empress. He abolished democracy, began a massive rearmament campaign and introduced conscription.\r\n\r\nIn 2001 Baresu\u00e2n annexed the Jynyhat region provoking little response from other Yhaltanian powers. Knebbian President Thed Maturad conceded this territory to Baresu\u00e2n in exchange for a promise of no further territorial demands. Greatly alarmed with Vumir making further demands on Koldavin, Knebb guarateed its support for Vorr\u00e2nian independence.\r\n\r\nThe Violet Fist, an Adhenian backed guerilla army assassinated the Dhexan consul in occupied J\u00fddstl. Dhex sent a peacekeeping force to the Jydmeq region in early 2040. The King of Adhen made a pact with Vorr\u00e2n that they would support each other if the other is invaded.\r\n\r\nTensions were also running high on the other side of the continent in the Shebish region between Gan and Lushin. The western part had been assimilated into the Kymel region, while the east held out for independence, backed by neighbouring Gan. Both sides warning that military activity in the area would be seen as an act of war.\r\n\r\nOn Dudahen 7th 2040 Baresu\u00e2n invaded Vorr\u00e2n. Three days later after a Knebbian ultimatum to cease military operations was ignored, Knebb declared war on Baresu\u00e2n.\r\n",

Now while he is spending the night alone he's visited by a sacred vision. Out of the fire appears the Holy Grail, symbol of God's divine grace. And a voice said to the boy, 'You shall be keeper of the grail so that it may heal the hearts of men.' But the boy was blinded by greater visions of a life filled with power and glory and beauty. And in this state of radical amazement he felt for a brief moment not like a boy, but invincible, like God, so he reached into the fire to take the grail, and the grail vanished, leaving him with his hand in the fire to be terribly wounded. Now as this boy grew older, his wound grew deeper. Until one day, life for him lost its reason. He had no faith in any man, not even himself. He couldn't love or feel loved. He was sick with experience. He began to die. One day a fool wandered into the castle and found the king alone. And being a fool, he was simple minded, he didn't see a king. He only saw a man alone and in pain. And he asked the king, 'What ails you friend?' The king replied, 'I'm thirsty. I need some water to cool my throat'. So the fool took a cup from beside his bed, filled it with water and handed it to the king. As the king began to drink, he realized his wound was healed. He looked in his hands and there was the holy grail, that which he sought all of his life. And he turned to the fool and said with amazement, 'How can you find that which my brightest and bravest could not?' And the fool replied, 'I don't know. I only knew that you were thirsty.' It's very beautiful, isn't it?</q> ~ Parry, The Fisher King.</p>\r\n\r\n![](/media/markdownx/2a0e930e-1969-494a-adf0-6c73ecb02560.png)\r\n\r\n![](/media/markdownx/bec2242c-116c-4bb2-81f8-d043e59d4280.png)\r\n\r\n<p class=\"clear\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n![](/media/markdownx/1ef72813-5787-4b0c-a15c-5b2b4c386b37.png)\r\n\r\n![](/media/markdownx/fb8e9cdd-3f58-43b2-ab10-18b8aab6fa40.png)\r\n\r\n<p class=\"clear\">&nbsp;</p>",

It features a stripped-down core, which only really provides the raw elements and a bit of legacy support. Game Universe specific features have been stripped out into minerals, materials, food, tools and equipment mods. These were re-introduced in sequence in order to get the chain of dependencies right. The game also provides legacy support for farming and moreores. The tech level of the core game is not intended to progress beyond Archimedean simple machines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Several features from darkages, cottages and moreblocks have either been incorporated or inspired reworking. I have also looked at and incorporated code and ideas from Carbone, ethereal, adventuretest and Dreambuilder.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the aims of the game is increased magical pseudo-realism; that is, things like crafting recipes should be logical and believable given the fantastic nature of the game-world. It is also intended to provide the player with a sense of progression through awards and earnable \"power-ups\" (limited privs). It is planned to increase the challenge of survival through hunger, mobs and natural disasters.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"release-title\">0.4.0 - <a href=\"/0-afflatus/grailtest/releases/tag/v0.4.0\">Avalonia</a></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This release is a complete rewrite from the ground up, featuring a total overhaul of the mapgen to support v5, v6, v7, valleys, flat and fractal mapgens. This is the core game; Experience, Fauna, Magic and Technology have been separated out and are currently being developed as separate mods, some of which will be included in future releases. This has had two months rigorous testing on a live server and has proved pretty reliable. This is the version running on our <a href=\"http://grailtest.pathilorra.co.uk/server.html\">server</a>, so if you want to test it out, hop on over.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Features</h4>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>New /welcome screen</li>\r\n<li>New default sounds (by Ingar)</li>\r\n<li>Mapgen auto compatibility</li>\r\n<li>Stamina (Sofar's rewrite of Blockmen's hunger)</li>\r\n<li>Sunflower seeds, mistletoe, blue mushroom</li>\r\n<li>New stone brick textures and Red stone tiles</li>\r\n<li>Decorative bones</li>\r\n<li>Adapted version of xdecor (by kilbith and others)</li>\r\n<li>Simplyslopes (by Delaroyas)</li>\r\n<li>Fachwerk - timber framed nodes</li>\r\n<li>Equipment_modpack including itemframes and pictures</li>\r\n<li>Basic bow (by Napiophelios) replaces throwing</li>\r\n<li>Barrel and vessels work together to ferment and dispense drinks</li>\r\n<li>Cheese can be fermented in barrels</li>\r\n<li>Variety of metal and wooden fences</li>\r\n<li>Steel trapdoor</li>\r\n<li>Written books, which can be copied</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"release-title\">0.3.2 - <a href=\"/0-afflatus/grailtest/releases/tag/v0.3.2\">Brythonia</a></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This version of grailtest is an unstable feature release compatible with minetest 0.4.13. It includes a magic system, linked to player development with earnable privs and enchantable items. This is the version which was running on the server during spring 2015, so it has had a lot of player testing and is now being maintained as a separate <code>grailtest</code> repository.

Mapgen only generates terrain (apart from v6, which places trees), so flora are placed by individual mods.

Some very common low-detail nodes, such as stone and grass, use 16x textures; Nodes requiring more detail may use 32x textures. Many new textures have been created specifically for this game, some are placeholders, awaiting better replacements. Texture credits may be found in the module's README.txt. Feel free to raise issues against any textures that are not DFSG compliant, have other potential licensing problems or suggest suitable replacements / solutions.</p>"

You move around using the <strong>WASD</strong> keys, <strong>space bar</strong> to jump / swim and <strong>Left Shift</strong> to go down or sneak. The first challenge is to build a house to protect you from nocturnal monsters and stash your treasure. </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"quote left\"><q>Follow your bliss.</q> ~ Joseph Campbell.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>\r\n<a id=\"user-content-gather-resources-and-build-something\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#gather-resources-and-build-something\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"octicon octicon-link\"></span></a>Gather resources and build something</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>To get started, find a tree. Click and hold with the left mouse button on the trunk until it breaks. A piece of tree trunk will appear in your inventory (the 'hotbar' at the bottom of the screen is the first row of your inventory). To select different items from the hotbar, use the mouse wheel, or the number keys 1-8. You place blocks by right-clicking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To open your inventory menu, press the I key on your keyboard. When you open your inventory, you will see a 3x3 box of squares at the top. This is the crafting grid. It is where you make the various items. Press Esc to close it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Craft planks and sticks then you can make a wooden pick, which will allow you to quarry stone, metal and gems. Once you get some cobble you can make a stone pick. When you have collected some ores you need to cook them in a furnace to turn them into ingots. Ingots can be crafted into tools, armour and other useful stuff. You can cook food in furnaces. You can also make glass from sand and turn cobble back into stone.</p>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"left\" src=\"images/penngwynn_farm.png\" alt=\"Farming\">\r\n\r\n<p>You heal hearts by eating things.

Each episode is approximately half an hour long.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/bJ_NYH4L1Ps\">Grailcast 1.1</a> - Gathering resources and building a shelter\r\n<li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/LEA7AvwJV9s\">Grailcast 1.2</a> - The inventory, controls and protection\r\n<li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/gP2QDHq2gmU\">Grailcast 1.3</a> - Building a timber-framed farmhouse\r\n<li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/5F-9XuWyy5w\">Grailcast 1.4</a> - Raising the roof and getting directions\r\n<li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/JG1q5KQyxDQ\">Grailcast 1.5</a> - Farming; grains and vegetables \r\n<li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/0dcekZylvik\">Grailcast 1.6</a> - Animals; taming and breeding\r\n<li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/lQQ2JXvK3xM\">Grailcast 1.7</a> - Cookery; food and drink\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The series was recorded on the Grail Test server, so it does depend on having additional mods installed, such as unified_inventory, mobs, areas and markers. The game is constantly in development, so some features may have changed a bit since these tutorials were made.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"clear\"/><hr /></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Chat commands</h2>\r\nGrail Test provides several text commands that you type into the chat prompt. Chat commands always start with a forward slash like this: <b>/</b>\r\n\r\n<h3>Information</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><p><code>/help [all/privs/&lt;command&gt;] </code> -- get help on using a chatcommand or list privs</p></li>\r\n<li><p><code>/status </code> -- show server status and Message Of The Day</p></li>\r\n<li><p><code>/welcome </code> -- show Welcome screen</p></li>\r\n<li><p><code>/mods </code> -- get a list of mods in the game</p></li>\r\n<li><p><code>/privs </code> -- list your privs</p></li>\r\n<li><p><code>/scores </code> -- show your score card</p></li>\r\n<li><p><code>/awards </code> -- get a graphical list of possible awards</p></li>\r\n<li><p><code>/awd &lt;award name&gt; </code> -- get details of an award</p></li>\r\n<li><p><code>/cawards </code> -- get a text list of possible awards</p></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Getting around</h3>\r\n\r\nPlayers have limited teleporting abilities - you can set a home location or request to teleport to another player and you can always get back to the town centre if you get lost.\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><p><code>/spawn </code> -- teleport back to the town centre</p></li>\r\n<li><p><code>/sethome </code> -- set your home to where you are now</p></li>\r\n<li><p><code>/home </code> -- go to your home position</p></li>\r\n<li><p><code>/tphr &lt;player&gt; </code> -- ask a player to teleport to you</p></li>\r\n<li><p><code>/tpn </code> -- refuse teleport request</p></li>\r\n<li><p><code>/tpr &lt;player&gt; </code> -- ask to teleport to another player</p></li>\r\n<li><p><code>/tpy </code> -- accept teleport request</p></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Advanced chat</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><p><code>/me &lt;action&gt; </code> -- pose a chat action</p></li>\r\n<li><p><code>/msg &lt;player&gt; &lt;message&gt; </code> -- send a Private Message to a player</p></li>\r\n<li><p><code>/mail &lt;player&gt; &lt;message&gt; </code> -- leave a Private Message in a player's inbox so they can read it later</p></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nAnd this could be useful. You can also drag things into the trash in your inventory. There is no need to dump unwanted items, but you can sell them or give them away.\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><p><code>/pulverize </code> -- destroy the item you are wielding</p></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>Areas</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The server includes Areas mod, which lets you protect areas that you're building. You can either select an area using markers or chatcommands.</p>\r\n\r\n<!-- Areas -->\r\n<h3><a id=\"user-content-tutorial\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#tutorial\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"octicon octicon-link\"></span></a>Tutorial</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>To protect an area you must first set the corner positions of the area.\r\nIn order to set the corner positions you can run:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><code>/area_pos set</code> and punch the two corner nodes to set them.</li>\r\n<li><code>/area_pos set1/set2</code> and punch only the first or second corner node to\r\nset them one at a time.</li>\r\n<li><code>/area_pos1/2</code> to set one of the positions to your current position.</li>\r\n<li><code>/area_pos1/2 X Y Z</code> to set one of the positions to the specified\r\ncoordinates.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Once you have set the border positions you can protect the area by running one\r\nof the following commands:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><code>/set_owner &lt;OwnerName&gt; &lt;AreaName&gt;</code> -- If you have the <code>areas</code> privilege.</li>\r\n<li><code>/protect &lt;AreaName&gt;</code> -- If you have the <code>areas</code> privilege or the server\r\nadministrator has enabled area self-protection.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The area name is used only for informational purposes (so that you know what\r\nan area is for).  It is not used for any other purpose.\r\nFor example: <code>/set_owner SomePlayer Mese city</code></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now that you own an area you may want to add sub-owners to it. You can do this\r\nwith the <code>add_owner</code> command.  Anyone with an area can use the <code>add_owner</code>\r\ncommand on their areas.  Before using the <code>add_owner</code> command you have to\r\nselect the corners of the sub-area as you did for <code>set_owner</code>. If your markers\r\nare still around your original area and you want to grant access to your\r\nentire area you will not have to re-set them. You can also use <code>select_area</code> to\r\nplace the markers at the corners of an existing area if you've reset your\r\nmarkers and want to grant access to a full area.\r\nThe <code>add_owner</code> command expects three arguments:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>The ID number of the parent area (the area that you want to add a\r\nsub-area to).</li>\r\n<li>The name of the player that will own the sub-area.</li>\r\n<li>The name of the sub-area.

Please be aware that some players do not like cursing, so please take care with your language.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Hassling for privs or chat spamming will result in gagging or toading.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Griefers will be arrested, probably without warning. It's not fun so don't bother.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Hacked clients are not welcome.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>On the internet you can be a banjo playing orang-utan from Mars if you want, nobody needs to know who you are in real life or where you live, not even the admins. Don't share your personal details.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Spoofing (pretending to be another player) is a bannable offence.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Dating is discouraged. If your real or in-game relationship starts annoying other players, you will be asked to play somewhere else.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>The map regularly gets cropped and regenerated beyond 3k from spawn in order to keep the map size manageable, so please don't bother building that far out.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"important\">\r\n<h2>Accounts</h2>\r\n<p>Every player must have a separate account, <strong>one</strong> per player; don't share your password with anyone else, especially not your younger brother.\r\nMultiple accounts and account sharing is <strong>not</strong> permitted on the Grail Test server without specific permission from me. Permission may be given if you have a good reason.\r\n\r\n<p>If friends and other family members want to play from the same IP I will gladly extend permission, so long as I know what's going on. I do not need or want details that would identify you in real-life, but it is useful to me to know if other players on your IP are friends, younger brothers / sisters or even parents. All are welcome so long as I'm kept informed of the situation.\r\n\r\n<p>If I find out that accounts are being shared or you are pretending to be another player, the consequences range from loss of privs to outright banning, depending on the disruption caused. I know this is different from other servers and I will give responsible players a chance to sort it out. So if you have been sharing your account or plan to do so, please let me know immediately and we can almost certainly come to some arrangement.

He had been told by a batty old wise woman that he was destined to build a fine temple and found a wealthy city.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Having survived the most terrible storms at sea and overcome the scariest monsters imaginable (mostly by telling them really bad jokes), Afflatus landed in the new world. He placed his left foot upon Exo Beach and recited this song.</p>\r\n<p>Safely crossed is the fertile sea, <br />\r\nFertile be the fruit-strewn mountain, <br />\r\nFruit-strewn be the showery wood, <br />\r\nShowery be the river of water-falls, <br />\r\nOf water-falls be the lake of deep pools, <br />\r\nDeep pooled be the hill-top well, <br />\r\nA well of the tribe be our haven, <br />\r\nA haven of brambles I invoke,<br />\r\nA haven of safety.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Using the power of magic, a hefty pick-axe and the assistance of a couple of bored stone-masons, Afflatus built a magnificent temple to the stars as the old woman had prophesied. And then when the last brick of the temple was securely in place, and not before, he built himself a house in the wilderness, with a very comfy bed; because quite frankly after all that he needed a decent kip.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"quote right\"><q>None of them had any idea where the Holy Grail really was, and I don't think any of them actually expected to find it, or would have known what to do with it if he had run across it.</q> ~ Mark Twain, A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He awoke to the sounds of banging, digging and swearing. It was the sound of a valiant brave journeyman knight, known only as CCD, who had just hit his own thumb with a rather large hammer. It wasn't long before more adventurers and settlers with their attendant hangers-on arrived and the wilderness was cleared to make way for homes, a forge and a pub.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a short time Bramble Haven grew to become a magnificent, if rather small, city - with its own cathedral, a grandiose town hall and a town guard that kept its streets free of monsters at night. Powerful warlords built castles and temples and rustic villages sprang up in between. For a while peace reigned and the land was fruitful.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then the former colony of Bramble Haven was hit with earthquakes and freak weather conditions. No movement or building was possible for several months.  A few survivors took to the high seas in the not-particularly-good ship The Stella Marie across the Ocean of Erehwon, through the Land of Dreaming in search of pastures new, while the chief wizard, Afflatus, attempted to unfreeze the former city and stop talking about himself in the third person. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brandin got possessed by an angry water spirit that made him burn down a whole forest and several people's homes. Afflatus managed to drive the demon away and make Brandin wake up back in Bramble Haven, where he was wanted for arson. Sadly the inhospitable conditions drove all the inhabitants away and Bramble Haven soon became a ghost town.</p>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"right\" src=\"images/pagoda.png\" alt=\"Pagoda\">\r\n\r\n<p>Afflatus single-handedly completed the voyage to the Land of Dreaming in order to fix the time-space anomalies that had led to Bramble Haven's demise and to find a suitable location for a new settlement. One day, as he was out hunting, he thought he caught a glimpse of the magnificent questing beast and gave chase. All the privileges in the world were no match for this magnificent creature and he soon lost sight of his quarry, he is now hopelessly lost in the awesome and slightly creepy Land of Annwn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Due to a teleportantion accident, one of the new settlers spawned in a cave beneath a magnificent and strange rock formation where there grew a magical orange tree. Afflatus took this as a sign that this was the ideal location for the new settlement. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>More survivors from Bramble Haven, including the Knight formerly known as Sir CCD who had become a Duke, found the new colony and other new settlers joined. The new town soon grew large enough to need a Mayor and a Town Clerk and host a Miner's Guild and a Gardening Association. The Miners mined so deep that they angered a sleeping rock giant, who ripped apart the rock in his fury. Afflatus sought the assistance of the Wizards Who Live Upstream, who discovered that there was indeed a glitch in the Source. Armed with this knowledge, the gaps in the space-time continuum could be repaired and the town could go back to its peaceful routine. For now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What happens now is up to you, should you choose to accept this bizarre quest. There are no guarantees, but if you have enough skill and imagination, you may be able to help Afflatus rebuild. Normality will be restored just as soon as it stops being a statistical benchmark. You have been enchanted ... </p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://grailtest.pathilorra.co.uk/playguide.html\">Player Guide</a><br />\r\n<a href=\"http://grailtest.pathilorra.co.uk/magic.html\">Secrets of the Magic System</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"clear\">&nbsp;</p>"
